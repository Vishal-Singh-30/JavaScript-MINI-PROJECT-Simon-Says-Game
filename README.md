# Simon Says Game

This repository contains the code for a "Simon Says Game" built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game is a classic memory challenge where the player must repeat a sequence of colors generated by the computer.



## Features

- **Start the Game**: Press any key to start the game.
- **Levels**: The game increases in difficulty with each level by adding a new color to the sequence.
- **User Interaction**: Players interact by clicking on colored buttons.
- **Feedback**: The game provides visual feedback for button presses and game over state.
- **Score Tracking**: Displays the current level and the highest score achieved.

## Files

- `index.html`: The main HTML file that structures the game layout.
- `style.css`: The CSS file for styling the game.
- `app.js`: The JavaScript file containing the game logic.

## HTML Structure

- A title and instructions for starting the game.
- A game board with four colored buttons: green, yellow, red, and blue.
- The game board is divided into two rows for a visually appealing layout.

## CSS Styling

- Basic styling to center the game elements and provide margins.
- Each button is styled with a distinct color and a flash effect to indicate a press.
- Game over feedback is visually indicated by changing the background color of the body to red temporarily.

## JavaScript Logic

- **Game Initialization**: The game starts when any key is pressed.
- **Sequences**: The game generates a random sequence of colors that the player must repeat.
- **User Input**: The player's input is tracked and compared against the game sequence.
- **Level Progression**: The player advances to the next level by successfully repeating the sequence.
- **Game Over**: If the player makes a mistake, the game displays a game-over message and resets.

## How to Play

1. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
2. Press any key to start the game.
3. Watch the sequence of colors and try to repeat it by clicking the colored buttons.
4. The game will advance to the next level if you correctly repeat the sequence.
5. If you make a mistake, the game will end and display your score. Press any key to restart.
